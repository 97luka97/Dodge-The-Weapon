# Dodge-The-Weapon
The application was made in SpriteKit. When the game starts you have the Play button that switches from MainMenu scene to GamePlay scene. When you start the game at the bottom of the screen is the ninja who has a class (Player.swift). He runs left-right. At the top of the screen for every 1-1.5 seconds in the random X position  appears a weapon (Weapon.swift). Weapon has 2 images and they are choosen by random. It falls down and if it hits ninja (if there is a collision detection), then a two-SKSpriteNodes disappear and jump out AlertView that says “You lost!” and the current score. If the weapon misses ninjas and goes under it, a label that prints Score increases by 1.
